### Normans seven principles:
    1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
    2. Simplify the structure of tasks
    3. Make things visible, bridge the gulfs of execution and evaluation
    4. Get the mappings right
    5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial
    6. Design for error
    7. When all else fails, standartise

### Nielsens ten heuristics of usability
    1. Visibility of system status
    2. Match between the system and the real world
    3. User control and freedom
    4. Consistency and standarts
    5. Error prevention
    6. Recognition rather than recall
    7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
    8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design
    9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
    10. Help and documentation 

### Shneidermans eight golden rules
    1. Strive for consistency
    2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
    3. Offer informative feedback
    4. Design dialogs to yield closure
    5. Offer error prevention and simple error handling
    6. Permit easy reversal of actions
    7. Support internal locus of control
    8. Reduce short-term memory load

    2. I found the system unnecessarily complex
    3. I thought the system was easy to use
    4. I think that I would need the support of a tchnical person to be able to use this system
    5. I found various functions un this system well integrated
    6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system 
    7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly

    9. I felt very confident using the system
    10. I needed to  learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.
